PROJECT: NYC PAYROLL DATA INTEGRATION

Project Overview

The City of New York is launching a project to integrate payroll data across all municipal agencies, with the goal of creating a comprehensive Data Analytics platform. This platform will serve two main objectives:

Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Assess how the City's financial resources are distributed, with a specific focus on the budget allocated to overtime pay.

Transparency and Public Accessibility: Provide public access to the data, offering transparency on how taxpayer money is spent on salaries and overtime across all City employees.

This initiative aims to enhance financial oversight and ensure transparency in the City's budget allocation.
