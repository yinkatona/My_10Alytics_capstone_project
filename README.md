#PROJECT: NYC PAYROLL DATA INTEGRATION

## Project Overview

- **Transparency and Public Accessibility**: Provide public access to payroll data, ensuring transparency in how taxpayer money is spent on salaries and overtime for all City employees.  

This initiative is designed to enhance financial oversight and promote transparency in the City's budget allocation.  

## Tech Stack
