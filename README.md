# Project: NYC Payroll Data Integration  

## Project Overview  

The City of New York is launching a project to integrate payroll data across all municipal agencies, aiming to develop a comprehensive Data Analytics platform. This platform will serve two key objectives:  

- **Financial Resource Allocation Analysis**: Evaluate how the City's financial resources are distributed, with a particular focus on the budget allocated to overtime pay.  
- **Transparency and Public Accessibility**: Provide public access to payroll data, ensuring transparency in how taxpayer money is spent on salaries and overtime for all City employees.  

This initiative is designed to enhance financial oversight and promote transparency in the City's budget allocation.
